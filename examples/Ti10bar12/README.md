# Example to calculate phonon structure of Ti under shear

This example is an attempt to reproduce the study of the following paper using
LAMMPS and polymlp machine learning potential.
https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.024106

About polymlp: https://sekocha.github.io/lammps/index-e.html

## Generation of sheared structures

See `generate_sheared_structures.ipynb`.

## How to run this example

```
bash run_lammps_and_phonopy.sh
```

Please watch insde `run_lammps_and_phonopy.sh` and modify appropriately.
